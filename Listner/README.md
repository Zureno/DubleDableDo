Netcat is the utility knife of networking, so it's no surprise that shrewd systems administrators remove it from their systems. In these cases it's useful to create a simple network client and server that we can use to push files, or to have a listener that gives you command-line access. If you've broken in through web application, it is definately worth dropping a Python callback to give you secondary access without having to first burn one the trojans or backdoors.
